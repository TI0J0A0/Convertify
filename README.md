This project started as a challenge to:

1. Learn how to **build a complete app from scratch** using modern tools like React and Tailwind.
2. **Work alongside an AI assistant** to speed up development, debug smarter, and understand solutions through code analysis.
3. Create a **practical, real-world app** useful in daily life ‚Äî without relying on cluttered or slow websites.
4. Gain confidence working with **API integrations** and core logic modeling.
